A 3D-enhanced AI-powered analytics dashboard with OpenAI integration

AI Dashboard

This project is a modern, responsive, and interactive web dashboard designed for visualizing data and interacting with an AI assistant. It features multiple sections, including a dashboard overview, 3D data visualizations, and an integrated AI chat powered by the OpenAI API.


Features
1.Responsive UI: A clean, dark-themed user interface built with Tailwind CSS that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

2.3D Data Analytics: Two distinct interactive 3D visualizations using Three.js:

3.Orbiting Data Points: A central sphere surrounded by orbiting data points to represent relationships.

4.Force-Directed Network Graph: A dynamic graph visualization for exploring complex network connections.

5.AI Chat Integration: A fully functional chat interface that connects to the OpenAI API, allowing users to ask questions and receive real-time responses.

6.Data Reporting: Placeholder sections for daily, weekly, and monthly reports.

7.User Profile: A dedicated page for user information and activity statistics with interactive charts powered by Chart.js.




How to Run

1.Save the file: Save the provided HTML code as index.html.

2.Open in Browser: Open index.html in your preferred web browser.

3.Add your OpenAI API Key: The AI Chat feature requires an OpenAI API key.

const apiKey = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE';

Once your key is added, the chat functionality will be fully enabled.





Technologies Used

1.HTML5 & JavaScript: The core structure and logic of the application.

2.CSS (Tailwind CSS): For a modern and responsive design.
